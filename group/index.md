The Plasma Astrophysics Group uses state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to model astrophysical plasmas. We focus on understanding the radiative plasma physics of magnetar flares, pulsar radio emission, accretion flows around black holes, and fast radio bursts.

## High-performance computing

We also have a long track-record in usage of high-performance computing solutions and building open-source simulation tools. As part of this effort, we are actively developing and mainintaing the modern GPU/CPU-portable plasma code Runko.


## Students 

I am always happy to discuss possible student projects in high-energy astrophysics and high-performance computing. See also the the list of currently available projects here.
