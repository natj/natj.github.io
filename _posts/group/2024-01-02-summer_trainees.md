## Computational Plasma Astrophysics Research

{: .text-justify}
Plasma astrophysics is a new, emerging research field aiming to understand the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas - hot ionized gases - from first principles.  The Computational Plasma Astrophysics research group at the University of Helsinki uses theoretical and computational methods to study the most extreme plasma environments around neutron stars and black holes. High-performance computing solutions and open-source simulation tools are essential to our research. To perform our numerical studies, we maintain our own computational laboratory with a dedicated in-house, >1000-core supercomputer. We use the cluster to develop the open-source plasma simulation framework Runko. The research group is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant project ILLUMINATOR.

Our research group is looking for ambitious summer trainees interested in studying extreme plasma phenomena with analytical and computational methods. The 1-3 month-long projects can form a basis for a Bachelor's and Master's thesis in astrophysics. Available projects include:

- 1) **Theoretical analysis of relativistic plasma waves in ultra-magnetized media.** The trainee will derive the plasma dispersion relations and analyze the wave properties of low-frequency radio waves traveling in neutron star magnetospheres. Understanding the wave dynamics around neutron stars is one of the most central open questions in high-energy astrophysics. It is crucial for establishing how pulsars, rotating neutron stars, produce their observed radio emission. Good mathematical skills are required. Completion of plasma physics courses is advantageous, although not required.
- 2) **Simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks in magnetized plasmas.** The trainee will simulate the formation and propagation of collisionless shocks with first-principles particle-in-cell simulations. Understanding the relativistic shock dynamics is important for deciphering the physics of recently discovered fast radio bursts from magnetars - strongly magnetized neutron stars. Good computational skills and previous experience with Python and/or C++ are advantageous, although not required.
- 3) **Numerical implementation of a quantum-suppressed synchrotron emission process to the open-source plasma code Runko.** The trainee will study the quantum synchrotron radiation process and implement a Monte Carlo method to simulate it. Quantum-modified radiative processes are crucial for interpreting the recently performed laboratory experiments of high-intensity, petawatt laser pulse interactions. The same mechanism also controls the generation of radiation near extreme astrophysical objects like neutron stars and black holes. Good analytical and computational skills and previous experience with Python and/or C++ are advantageous, although not required.
