title: "Spreading layers around neutron stars"
toc: false
categories: articles
excerpt: "When an accretion disk around a neutron star touches the star, it can form a so-called spreading layer. In a work led by P. Abolmasov, we designed a new 2D spherical spectral code to simulate the dynamics of these layers. Code is, obviously, called SLayer."
