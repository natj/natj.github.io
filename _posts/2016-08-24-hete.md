excerpt: "Some peculiar X-ray bursts are found to have atmospheres that are made almost completely of heavy metals. A radiatively driven wind might then ejects some of the burning ashes into the interstellar space."

Explosive nuclear burning reactions in the NS envelope fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier elements.
By applying our atmosphere models with metal enriched atmospheres we are able to detect some of these metals.
It is possible that a radiatively driven wind ejects some of the burning ashes into the interstellar space acting as a source of heavy metal pollution in the atmosphere.

You can find the article from the [Arxiv.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06801)

Top figure also shows some non-published residuals between two competing models. Some Joy Division vibes can also be detected. Funnily enough, the original album cover was also inspired by neutron stars.
